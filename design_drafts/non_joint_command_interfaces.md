# Definition of command interfaces for non-joint related information

## Motivation
Already multiple times, users raised the question about the handling of non-joint-related interfaces.
Such interfaces are not considerd during [design of the ros2_control URDF-tag structure](./components_architecture_and_urdf_examples.md).
The design proposes two possibilities to classify (group) the interfaces, using `<joint>` and `<sensor>` tags.
`<joint>`-tag groups the interfaces associated with the joints of physical robots and actuators.
They have command and state interfaces to set the goal values for hardware and read its current state.
`<sensor>`-tag groups multiple state interfaces describing, e.g., internal states of hardware.

Most modern robots, especially industrial manipulators, also have other physical ports to control external hardware.
The most usual ones are General Purpose Inputs/Outputs (GPIOs).
Although the strict definition considers only digital ports, the term GPIO in this document describes any (one-dimensional) input/output port of physical hardware, e.g., digital or analog input/output.

## Problem
To use GPIOs in the ros2_control framework, they have to be listed in the robot's URDF: inputs (state interfaces) under a `<sensor>`-tag and output (command and state interfaces) under a `<joint>`-tag.
This could lead to confusion since non-existing (virtual) joints have to be defined in the ros2_control part of the URDF structure. 
"Joint" is a well-defined term in robotics. Therefore this naming should be avoided, i.e., another keyword should be used describing GPIOs,  semantically separating them from the kinematics joints.

## Proposed solution
Use of keyword "gpio" when describing input and output ports of a robotic device that cannot be associated with any joint or sensor.
Parsing of `<gpio>-tag` is similar to this of a `<joint>`-tag having command and state interfaces.
The tag must have at least one `<command>`- or `<state>`-tag as a child.

The keyword "gpio" is chosen for its generality.
Although strictly used for digital signals, in this document describes any electrical analog, digital signal, or physical value.

The `<gpio>` tag can be used as a child of all three types of hardware interfaces, i.e., system, sensor, or actuator.
Semantically, they describe values that can not be associated with a joint or a sensor.

### Solution for robots with many GPIO interfaces by using semantic components
 
The idea of semantic components is introduced in [hardware_access.md](./hardware_access.md) file.
The semantic components should simplify the management of state and command interfaces on the hardware and controller side by providing standardized structures.
This is especially useful for cases where long lists of interfaces have to be defined manually in URDF, as GPIOs.

As described above, there are two types of GPIO structures, inputs and outputs.
Inputs have only one state interface, where output has one command and one state interface.
Besides that, GPIOs are usually found in "arrays".
Currently, users need to define each interface individually, which results in much repetitive code.

This could be made shorter by using semantic components on the hardware and controller side.
Interface from the hardware of this semantic component would be used like:

```
# In hardware_interface::configure
my_digital_outputs = GPIO(name = "digital_out", size = "7")   # initialize storage and interfaces for GPIO array
                                                              # the names are, e.g., "digital_out_1", "digital_out_2", ...
...

# In hardware_inteface::export_state_interfaces
state_interfaces_ = my_digital_outputs.get_state_interfaces()
...

# In hardware_inteface::export_command_interfaces
command_interfaces_ = my_digital_outputs.get_command_interfaces()
...


# In hardware_inteface::read
my_digital_output.set_output_state(output_nr = 1, state_from_hw_digital_output_1);
...

# In hardware_interface::write

if (my_digital_output.is_updated(output_nr = 1)) {
  set_state_to_hardware_digital_output_1 = my_digital_output.get_digital_output(output_nr = 1);
}

```

The controller would have a similar logic, but using `LoanedHandles` instead of handles and setting command interfaces and reading state interfaces.
